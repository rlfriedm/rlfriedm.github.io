In this post I’m going to briefly summarize everything that has happened over the past semester and some of what will be happening in the future! The first thing I want to mention is that this past October I had the amazing opportunity to attend the world’s largest conference celebrating women in computing, [The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing](gracehopper.org). It was certainly an amazing experience; I was able to attend through a scholarship I received from the Anita Borg Institute sponsored by Broadcom. The Hamilton College Computer Science department also brought 5 other students with funding from the Clare Boothe Luce foundation. The conference consisted of over 4,600 attendees, an overwhelming majority of whom were technical women ranging from students to industry veterans. It was certainly a unique and powerful experience seeing so many technical women gathered together in one place.

Here is a picture of the Hamilton group:

At the conference I had the chance to speak with representatives from many different tech companies and interviewed with a bunch as well. One of the companies I interviewed with at the conference was [Cisco](cisco.com) and, on that note, I’m pleased to announce that I will be working as a software engineering intern at Cisco this coming summer! I am very excited to work at Cisco and spend some time in California as well!

In terms of college classes, this past semester I learned about databases and did a bunch of x86 Assembly language programming. It’s certainly interesting (and useful) to understand how things work on a lower level than usual. Our final project was to write an assembler for a simplified assembly language. Definitely a tricky project, but it turned out well in the end and I learned a lot. We also got to write a program that would play music through DOS by channeling specific frequencies to the computer’s speakers. This was probably the most fun assembly project and in the end probably the trickiest part for me was learning how to read sheet music so I could transcribe it into my notation.

Classes are about to start up again and I’m excited for the coming semester! I hope to be able to continue to work on a project I started over this winter break. I’ve started working on a platforming game for Android (and desktop). I’ll probably write an individual post about this project in the near future. Here is a screenshot of the not so impressive looking current progress (note - art is preliminary):

I’ve mostly been doing background things such as getting collisions working, thinking about touch screen controls, and learning what I can do with [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) (the game engine I’m using). This is also my first time working with Java, but no issues there so far!&nbsp;
