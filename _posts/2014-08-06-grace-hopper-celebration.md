Tomorrow I am headed to Phoenix, AZ for the amazing Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. I am lucky enough to have received a scholarship to go again this year and I am incredibly excited for the upcoming week. I’ve been looking forward to this event ever since I left the last conference. This year an astounding 8,000 people will be attending the conference up from around 5,000 last year. The support for women in computing is clearly growing and more and more people are looking at a lack of diversity as a serious issue in the computing field, and taking the steps to solve the problem! Only through having lots of different perspectives involved in creating the things we all use will we be able to make the best products and have the largest impact on how people live.

This year keynote speakers include a Turing Award winner, Dr. Shafi Goldwasser, the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, as well as the director of DARPA, Dr. Arati Prabhakar. There is also now a top secret special guest on Thursday before the scheduled keynote (I’m really curious as to who it is).

&nbsp;I’m planning to document the experience better than I did last year hopefully with a few blog posts after this one.&nbsp;
