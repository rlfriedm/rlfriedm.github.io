Over the past month I’ve been working on a game for Android (using the Unity game engine) called Chroma Collide. The player is a square at the bottom of the screen and the objective is to dodge blocks as they come down the screen at you. The twist is that blocks that you are the same color as you must hit, otherwise you lose. Every time the player hits a matching color block, the player’s color changes to a new random color. The game is controlled by tapping on the right or left side of the screen to move the block left or right. If the screen is not touched, the block moves back to the center on its own. The game is designed to be a quick pick up and play game where the player wants to keep playing to try and beat his or her high score. It starts out slow and then gets faster and faster as you go along.

The game itself is pretty much done, however I want to polish the menus and UI before releasing it to the Google Play store. This will be my first entirely finished game (once I get it done) and I’m excited to release something! I’ve already integrated Google Play Services so there will be achievements and high scores.

Here is a preview:
