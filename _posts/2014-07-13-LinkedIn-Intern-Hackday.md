This past weekend I had the opportunity to attend my first Hackathon! It was a great experience (despite the 36 hours with no sleep). My team had never met before but together, with a few bumps along the way, we were able to make an app we’ve called FoodScan. Our app allows users to input a list of their allergies and then scan food barcodes to see if any of their specified allergens are in the food. The premise is that this is simple and quick to use; just input your list of allergies and scan anything to get a simple yes or no response. My sister and I both grew up with (and still have) allergies, so I know firsthand how reading labels all the time is not a fun experience. Another important feature of our app is that it allows users to maintain a list of multiple people’s food allergies. This could be useful in cases where you want to know if a particular product is good for everyone in a group to eat. For example,&nbsp; a camp counselor could enter in&nbsp; all of the campers’ food allergies and then when buying food could simply scan the product rather than having to manually look over a list of everyone’s food restrictions every time.

The UI of the app isn’t amazing, but given the time constraints I’m happy with what we accomplished. I’m hoping to participate in another Hackathon sometime this year (and hopefully organize a small one at my college)!&nbsp;
