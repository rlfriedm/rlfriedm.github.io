As the semester comes to a close, it is time for some updates. Firstly, I am excited to announce that following graduation (and a couple months off) I will be joining Google as a software engineer! Google has been a company I’ve looked up to for a long time and I’m very happy that getting to work for Google will be my first job out of college. I’m a big fan of Google’s products and am excited to get to work for a company whose products have such a wide reaching impact. I won’t know what team I’ll be on until closer to starting, but I’m sure whatever I get on will be a great experience.

In other news, I will soon be putting together my first PC which I will be using next semester for my honors thesis project involving the Oculus Rift DK2. The plan for the thesis is still under construction, but I will be working on prototyping some ideas over the winter break. Currently, I am thinking about looking into the potential for education in virtual reality. Overall, I’m very excited to get to work with virtual reality in general and am looking forward to getting to spend a significant portion of my time next semester prototyping VR ideas.

On the topic of VR, I’m also very excited about Google Cardboard. I now have a couple of Google Cardboards and am really impressed by the quality of the VR experience considering the cost of the device. I’ve been able to show some friends some demos using Cardboard and everyone was pretty shocked (in a good way) considering they hadn't seen any VR before. Google also [recently announced](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/10/google-updates-its-cardboard-vr-app-launches-sdks-for-android-and-unity/?ncid=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29) they are devoting more efforts towards Cardboard and released a Unity SDK which I plan to take advantage of. I’m hoping this is indicative of Google pushing forward in VR overall!&nbsp;
